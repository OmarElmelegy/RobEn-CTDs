This repo contains some fun & interesting coding challenges we explored in RobEn AI team


## ⚔️ Challenges are:

-  **🎡 How big can you get:** Use loops and lists to get a list of numbers from the user and stop when the user enters a 'q', then print the largest and smallest number in that list wherever it is.


-  **🦋  Social Butterfly:** Code for a social network, you want to get a list of mutual friends between two people, and return names of mutual friends between them. 

-  **🎲 Life is randomness:** You are making a collection of games. Make a program that takes input from user to choose which simple game to play, then plays that game and loop over to let him choose again, unless the user enters 'exit' then the program may exit, the program include 3 games: coin toss, random number generator and a choice maker that chooses for you randomly.

-  **⚽ RandomTeamsRobEn:** A code that was written outside the challenges by me to have some fun, it takes a number of people who want to play football with us and outputs random teams depending on the input to it.

-  **🧾 RobEnDB:** A DataBase using python & files to store names, birthdays and ages of people, then retrieve or delete entries whenever the user wants to.

-  **📺 RobEnDBMyTube:** A simple Python project that uses Python libraries to search for videos on YouTube and download with optional resolutions for different streams to a specific folder.

-  **⚔️🧙‍♂️ Bag Game: A Random Tradition:** A game that is considered the tradition of RobEn. It is a CLI interface game that combines the main elements of turn-based RPG, randomness of computer decisions and green bags of coins. It also shows a photo when the game ends using open-cv library to declare a winner or a loser.
